## File opening modes

In Python, file opening modes are specified using strings passed as the second argument to the open() function. Here are the equivalent file opening modes in Python:

### Read Mode:

"r": Opens the file for reading.
open() function with mode "r" can be used to read from the file.

### Write Mode:

"w": Opens the file for writing, truncating the file if it already exists.
"w" mode creates a new empty file if it doesn't exist.
open() function with mode "w" can be used for writing.

### Append Mode:

"a": Opens the file for writing in append mode.
If the file exists, it appends data to the end of the file. If the file doesn't exist, it creates a new file.
open() function with mode "a" can be used.

### Read-Write Mode:

"r+" or "w+": Opens the file for both reading and writing.
open() function with mode "r+" or "w+" can be used.

### Binary Mode:

"b": This mode is used in combination with other modes to indicate that the file should be treated as binary data.
For example, "rb" for reading binary and "wb" for writing binary.

### Create Mode:

"x": This mode is used to create a new file. If the file already exists, it raises a FileExistsError.
"a" mode can also be used in combination with "x" to create a new file if it doesn't exist.
open() function with mode "x" can be used to create a new file.
